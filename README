We recommend to use docker for runnig our jupyter notebooks in the required environment as following:

1. Build our custom docker image in the current directory
	%./build_dockerimage.sh

2. Run a docker container to start jupyter
	%./run_jupyter.sh

3. Open localhost:8888 and follow the jupyter instruction


To run the test scripts

1. Replace script filename (anonymization_adult-NN1.py by default) with one in test directory

2. Run a docker container to run the python script
    %./run_testscript.sh
